# MyPortfolio
Portfolio Website – A fully responsive static website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with minimal JavaScript for interactivity. This website serves as a central hub to showcase my skills, projects, and learning journey in web development. It features:

Responsive Layouts: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using Bootstrap’s grid system.

Interactive UI Elements: Smooth scrolling, hover effects, and subtle animations to enhance user experience.

Project Showcase: Detailed sections highlighting my MERN stack projects, DOM-based mini projects, and other experiments, including links and descriptions.

About & Contact Sections: Professional introduction and contact form (or links) to allow easy connection and collaboration.

Clean, Modern Design: Focused on readability, usability, and visually appealing structure.

Though it’s mostly static, it demonstrates best practices in web design and frontend development, providing a professional online presence and a foundation for future full-stack enhancements.
